 strategy.
Sampling is useful both for a preliminary investigation and a final data analysis.
A sample, often, is as effective as the entire dataset <em><strong>if the set is representative</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Type of sampling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simple random: a simple random choice of an object with a given probability distribution</li>
<li>With replacement: like simple random but with multiple repetition of independent extraction</li>
<li>Without replacement: Like with replacement but, at each extraction, the element is removed from the possible one</li>
<li>Stratified: the data is separated in different partition according to some criteria and the random sample are draw from each partition. This guarantee representativity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A trade-off between data reduction and precision must be made.</p>
<h2>Missing classes</h2>
<p>The probability of sampling at least one element of each class is independent from the size of the dataset but is very important to have a representative sampling in order to properly train the machine learning model.
If there is a high number of classes with low representativity, it could be difficult to get a good test/train or <a href="./Cross_validation.html">Cross validation</a>
