                <p>Pruning, as for <a href="./Architectures_and_platforms_for_Artificial_Intelligence_Quantization_(a.k.a._magic_with_numbers).html">Quantization</a>
 is a technique to have smaller <a href="./Machine_learning_Classification_Neural_networks.html">Neural networks</a>
. It consists in deleting all the unused (or not-frequently used) connections in the network by zeroing them.
There are two ways to deal with pruning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unstructured pruning: decide a value threshold and zero all the weights under that value. The problem is that we can not fully exploit the pruned network since there is no way to predict where the 0s are, therefore, it is impossible to skip a MAC</li>
<li>Structured pruning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Structured pruning</h2>
<p>Deals with the problems of unstructured pruning. There are two main ways:</p>
<h3>Block-based pruning</h3>
<p>Do not prune only one element but blocks of elements (using some pre-defined metrics such as RMSE). This way we know, a priori, that if we see a 0 we will see many more afterwards, and we can skip some MACS. </p>
<h3>Node-based pruning</h3>
<p>We delete entire nodes instead of single connections-weights. If we do this during training, we can obtain 0 accuracy loss and gain in speed.</p>
<p>Pruning can be also done on the activations but this is a much more difficult process since it must be done during inference and we can&#39;t know how many 0s are there gonna be. A solution is to keep a &quot;map&quot; that tells us how many non 0 values are there in the activation. Even though this approach works, it also requires additional computation since it require keeping the map always update and the gain in speed is not that important.</p>
