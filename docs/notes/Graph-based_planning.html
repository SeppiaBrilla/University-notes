                <p>Is a <a href="./Planning.html">Planning</a>
 strategy proposed in 1995 that creates a graph called <strong>Planning graph</strong> while planning. It is correct, complete and one of the most efficient planner.
It returns either the shortest possible path or an inconsistency. It inherits early commitment from <a href="./Linear_planning.html">Linear planning</a>
 (e.g. action A is executed at step 2) but also inherit from <a href="./Non-linear_planning_-_Partial_order_planning_(POP).html">non linear planning</a>
 the ability to create a partially ordered set of actions.
Actions are like in <a href="./Strips.html">Strips</a>
, objects have a type and there is an action No-op that does nothing to resolve the frame problem (<a href="./Deductive_planning.html">Deductive planning</a>
). States are represented as true predicate in that state.
The graph is leveled: every node has a level, and arcs connect nodes in adjacent levels.
There are two type of levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposition level: where nodes represent propositions</li>
<li>Action level: where nodes represent actions</li>
</ul>
<p>At level 0 there is the initial state (proposition level) and arcs are divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Precondition arcs (proposition -&gt; action)</li>
<li>Add arcs (action -&gt; proposition) (a new proposition holds)</li>
<li>Delete arcs (Action -&gt; proposition) (a proposition gets deleted)</li>
</ul>
<p>During the graph creation, incosistencies between actions or prepositions may occour but. They may appear together in the same level, but they will not appear on the same plan.</p>
<p>Once the graph has been build, we need to extract a valid plan out of it.
Valid plan features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action on the same level can be executed in any order</li>
<li>Proposition at the same step must be not mutually exclusive</li>
<li>The last level contains all literals that are not mutually exclusive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Theorems</h3>
<ul>
<li>if there is a valid plan then this is a subgraph of the planning graph</li>
<li>A valid plan with mutually exclusive propositions at the same level does not exist</li>
<li>In a planning graph two propositions are mutually exclusive in a level if they are inconsistent.</li>
</ul>
