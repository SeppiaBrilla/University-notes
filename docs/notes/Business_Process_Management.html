                <p>It helps with business decisions.
There are different possible business prospective.</p>
<h3>High level prospectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Organizational (describe I/O, expected outcomes and dependecies) vs operational (activities are specified, implementation is disregarded)</li>
<li>Intra (all activities are executed within the business boundaries) vs Iner organization (part of the activities executed somewhere else)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activity model and instances</h2>
<p>An activity instance is the work conduced during the execution of the business instances. Events in an instance are temporarily ordered. An activity model is a set of similar instances.</p>
<p>Process modelling can be divided in 3 key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control flow</strong> that describes the process and order the activities in it. It can be <em>procedural</em> (order of the steps) or <em>declarative</em> (focus on the properties that should hold during the execution) also <em>open</em> (specifies allowed and forbidden activities) or <em>closed</em> (activities get executed only if the process specifies so)</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> produced and analyzed by the instances</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> and structure that enable the execution of the BPs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Control flow pattern</h2>
<p>The control flow is described by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequence</strong>: state of the ordering activities</li>
<li><strong>And/parallel split</strong>: the activities are split in multiple ones executed concurrently</li>
<li><strong>And/parallel join</strong>: multiple, concurrent, activities are joined in one</li>
<li><strong>Xor split/and xor join</strong>: only one of the several branches is chosen when splitting</li>
<li><strong>or join</strong>: same as and join, but we don&#39;t necessarily need to wait all activities to be completed in order to proceed</li>
<li><strong>multiple merge</strong>: multiple threads of control join without synchronization</li>
<li><strong>discriminator</strong>: waits for one of the incoming branches to complete and trigger the
 subsequent activity (then wait for the other branches and ignore them)</li>
<li><strong>n out of m</strong>: wait for N out of M (nâ‰¤m) branches to be completed (and ignore the
 remaining)</li>
<li><strong>arbitrary circles</strong>: introduce loop using xor split/join</li>
<li><strong>multiple instances</strong>: concatenation of several instances</li>
</ul>
