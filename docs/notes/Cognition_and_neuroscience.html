                <h1>Neuroscience</h1>
<p>The study of how the nervous system is organized and functions.
It works at different level of investigation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Molecular</strong>: molecular neuro-anatomy, mechanisms of molecular signaling in the nervous system</li>
<li><strong>Cellular</strong>: study of neurons at a cellular level including morphology and physiological properties</li>
<li><strong>Neural circuits and system</strong>: how neural circuits are formed and function to generate behaviors, such as:<ul>
<li>sensory perception and multi-sensory integration</li>
<li>motor reflex and actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Localizationism</h3>
<p>The theory that tells that each part of the human brain is specialized in something.</p>
<h3>Aggregate field theory</h3>
<p>The theory that tells that some areas of the brain are more specialized, but the whole brain works to achieve something.</p>
<p>We now know that both theories are partially true.</p>
<h2>Others cool stuff about neuroscience history</h2>
<h3>Cytoarchitectonics</h3>
<p>The study of cellular architecture or how cells differ between regions.</p>
<h3>The black reaction</h3>
<p>it permits to visualize individual neurons thanks to silver chromate.</p>
<h3>Neuron doctrine</h3>
<p>The nervous system is made of single individual cells</p>
<h3>Principle of dynamic polarization</h3>
<p>The signal in the neurons has a direction</p>
<h3>Principle of connectional specificity</h3>
<p>There are specific points where the cells connect to each other, and they are not random.</p>
<h3>Synapses</h3>
<p>Connections between neurons. They can be chemical or electrical.</p>
<h1>Cognition</h1>
<p>The description, explanation, and simulation of human thought processes.
It includes many processes like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception</strong>: take in information from the environment</li>
<li><strong>Attention</strong>: allows tfocusing- <strong>Learning</strong>: manipulation of new information and integration with prior knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: store information</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: use information to interact with the environment</li>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: the ability to understand and express thoughts, it allows communication.</li>
<li><strong>Thought</strong>: allows decision-making and problem-solving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some cool stuff about cognition</h2>
<h3>Rationalism</h3>
<p>The belif that all knowledge could be gained through reasoning. It is kinda becomed a religion.</p>
<h3>Empiricism</h3>
<p>The belif that all knowledge comes from nature and observation of phenomena. The reasoning is just the process of aggregating information gained through observation.</p>
<h3>Montreal&#39;s procedure</h3>
<p>A method to treat epilepsy by destroyng the neurons causing it.</p>
