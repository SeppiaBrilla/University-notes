It is a machine learning tecnique with a similar objective as [[Classification]] but it has a continuos domain ($\mathbb{R}$) instead of a descrete one.
Regression models can be achieved only with [[Supervised learning]] tecniques and they mainly try to minimize the error of the prediction with the respect of a specific target.

## Types of regression:
- [[Linear regression]]
- [[Multiple regression]]
- [[Polinomial regression]]



## Overfitting and Regularization

Like every machine learning tecnique, regression methods are prone to [[overfitting]] but a regularization process could reduce the problem by reducing the influence of less important features.
