It is a machine learning technique with a similar objective as [[Classification]] but it has a continuous domain ($\mathbb{R}$) instead of a discrete one.
Regression models can be achieved only with [[Supervised learning]] tecniques. They mainly try to minimize the error of the prediction with the respect to a specific target.

## Types of regression:
- [[Linear regression]]
- [[Multiple regression]]
- [[Polinomial regression]]



## Overfitting and Regularization

Like every machine learning tecnique, regression methods are prone to [[overfitting]] but a regularization process could reduce the problem by reducing the influence of less important features.
