Our data can have a lot of problems associated with it:
- noise and outliers
- missing values
- duplicates
- inconsistencies

This problem must be resolved or mitigated before we can work with the data.


### Noise

We define noise as the modification of the original value ([[Inherent error]]). For example, transmission may have noise that modifies the curve associated with the transmission 

### Outliers

We can have data characteristics that are different from most of our dataset. They can be noise releted or may rapresent rare events.
Example: 
| Temperature | outiler|
| ----------- | ----|
| 15          | no|
| 20          | no|
| 18          | no|
| 25          | no|
| 100            | yes|


Outliers are often identified with a box plot:

### Missing values

Posslible reasons: 
- data not collected
- information is not applicable

Management of missing values: 
- do not consider object with missing values
- use a default or an estimate value
- ignore it
- insert all possible values weighted with possibility

### Duplicate data
they can be generated by mixing differente sources. A difficult data cleaning process is needed
