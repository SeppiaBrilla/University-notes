We can perform some kind of transformation on our [[Data]]. That may allow us to use algorithms that can work only a specific type of data or to better understand it.
Types of transformation:
- Transformation on [[Nominal data type]]: Any one - to - one corrispondence (SSN / codice fiscale can be reassigned)
- Transformation on [[Ordinal data type]]: any order preserving transformation (good, mid, bad -> 3, 2, 1)
- Transformation on [[Interval data type]]: any linear function
- Transformation on [[Ratio data type]]: any matematical function
