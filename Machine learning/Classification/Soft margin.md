It is a method to find a separation between class for the [[Perceptron]].
This method do not tries to find the best possible separation but a good one. 
In this way we can reduce overfitting, and we can be more robust against individual observations.
It is obtained by adding a constraint to the optimization problem: the __c parameter__.
It is a penalty parameter that controls the amount of overfitting, and his tuning is crucial.
