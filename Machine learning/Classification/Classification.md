Classification is a type of problem we can solve with machine learning tecniques.
Any classification problem is shaped as a set of characteristic that we want to label.
Example: finding the correct desease to a patient, find the specie of an animal, ...

Some classification algorithms are:
- [[LDA]]
- [[PCA]]
- [[Maximum likelihood estimation]], [[MAP (maximum a posteriori)]] 



## Types of classification

We can find two type of classification (that, in reality, are the same for all machine learning tecniques):
- [[Unsupervised learning]]. Often, with classification, the unsupervised tecniques are known with other names different from classification ([[PCA]] is often referred as a demensionality reduction tecnique)
- [[Supervised learning]] -> [[Supervised classification]]


## Evaluation of a classifier

We want to know which is the best combination of model, algorithms and parameter to classify our data.
