It is a [[Data pre-processing]] tecnique.
Aggregation is achieved by combining two or more objects into a single one.
Example: 
city1
city2
city3
city4

(city1, city2) = region1
(city3, city4) = region2

This process is usefull to reduce the number of attribute or objects, change the scale and have a more stable data less prone to noise and variability.
