### A local way to reduce dimensionality

- Remove redundant attributes that a given dataset may have.
- Remove irrelevant attributes not usefull in the analysis.
- Bruteforce: try all prossible subsets 
- Embed approach: Feature selection cames out as a natural selection in some algorithms like [[Decision tree]]
- Filter approach: feature are selecteb before the dataminimg algorithm 
- Wrapper approach: the dataminimg alogrithm chooses the best set of attributes
