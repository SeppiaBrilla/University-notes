Sometimes the data we want to use in our machine learning algorithms needs some sort of pre-processing to be cleaned or reshaped in a way that helps the algorithm we're using to be more effective.

## Types of data pre-processing
- [[Aggregation]]
- [[Sampling]]
- [[Dimensionality reduction]]
- [[Feature subset selection]]
- [[Feature creation]]
- [[Type conversion]]
- [[Similarity and dissimilarity]]
- [[Transformations]]
