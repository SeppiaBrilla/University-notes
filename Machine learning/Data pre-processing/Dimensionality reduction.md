When dimensionality is very high, the occupation of the space is very spare and this could cause some problems with some methods based on distance discrimination.
Dimensionality reduction is a [[Data pre-processing]] tecnique that erase some dimensions while keeping the most of the information.

Some tecniques are:
- [[PCA]]
- [[SVD]]
- supervised tecniques
- non-linear tecniques
