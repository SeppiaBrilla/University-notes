Standard processors are not very efficient for most of the [[Convolutional neural networks]], but there are many improvements that can be done in order to make them faster:
- transform every operation in matrix multiplication and design a processor very fast with those
- [[ISA extension]]
- [[Multi processor extensions]]
- [[Tiling]]
