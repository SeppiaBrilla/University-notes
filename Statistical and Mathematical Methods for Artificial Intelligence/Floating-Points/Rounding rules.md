A real number $x \notin F$ that need to be rounded to $\tilde{x} \in F$ where $F$ is a [[Floating-Point number]]  system can be rounded with two commonly used rules: 
 - __chop__ : truncate $\beta$ base expansion to the t-st digit; also called the "*toward zero*" rule 
 - __round to nearest__ : $\tilde{x}$ is the nearest [[Floating-Point number]] to x using [[Floating-Point number]] whose even in case of tie; also called "*round to even*"  
 **Round to nearest** is the most precise  and the default rounding rule in [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) system
