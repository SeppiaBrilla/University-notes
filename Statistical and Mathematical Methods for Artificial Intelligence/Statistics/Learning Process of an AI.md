The learning process process for an artificial intelligence can be divided in three steps:
- [[Define a model for learning process in AI|Define a model]]
- [[Training or parameter estimation for learning process of AI|Training or parameter estimation]]
- [[Hyperparameter tuning for learning process of AI|Hyperparameter tuning]]
