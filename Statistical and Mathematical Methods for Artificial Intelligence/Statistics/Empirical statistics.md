There [[Statistic]] defined on the true population are called "_population statistics_" because they assume to work on all the possible population but often that is not the case. In empirical Statistics we define the [[Statistic]] starting from the data we have collected.

We can define the [[mean for discrete random variables]] as:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 1}^N x_n
$$
Where $N$ is the number of elements collected.
Also we can define the empirical [[Covariance]] as:
$$
\Sigma = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 1}^N (x_n - \bar{x})(x_n - \bar{x})^T
$$
