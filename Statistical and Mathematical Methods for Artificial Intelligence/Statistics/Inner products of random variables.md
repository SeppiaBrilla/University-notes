If we see two [[Random variable]] as vectors we can define the [[Dot product|inner product]] between them.
$$
\left<X, Y\right> := Cov[x,y] 
$$
And
$$
||X|| = \sqrt{\left<X,X\right>} = \sqrt{Cov[X,X]} = \sqrt{\mathbb{V}[x]} = \sigma[x] 
$$
([[Covariance]], [[variance for discrete random variables]], [[variance for probaility density functions]], [[Standard deviation]])
