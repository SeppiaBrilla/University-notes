$$
cov[x,y] = \mathbb{E}[x * y] - \mathbb{E}[x] * \mathbb{E}[y] 
$$
([[Expected value]])
The [[variance for discrete random variables]] or [[variance for probaility density functions]] can be seen a special case of covariance where $x = y$:
$$
cov[x,x] = \mathbb{E}[x * x] - \mathbb{E}[x] * \mathbb{E}[x] = V_x[x] 
$$

In the case of [[multivariate random variable]] the covariance is a matrix of size $d \times d$ where $d$ is the dimension of the variable and it is symmetric and [[positive definite]]
