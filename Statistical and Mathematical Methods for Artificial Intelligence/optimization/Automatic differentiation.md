[[Backpropagation]] is a particular case of an automatic differentiation algorithm that compute the [[Gradient]] of a function using the [[The chain rule for functions of vectors]]. The idea is to decompose the basic function as a composition of simpler ones and compute the [[Partial derivative]] of the simpler functions. Then build a graph using the results and compute the [[Gradient]] by combining the simpler [[Partial derivative]] using the [[The chain rule for functions of vectors]].
