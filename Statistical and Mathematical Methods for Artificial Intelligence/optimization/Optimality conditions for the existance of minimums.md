- First order condition:
	if $x^*$ is a point of [[Local minimum]] for $f$ and $f$ is [[Differentiable with continuity]] around $x^*$ then $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ ([[Gradient]], [[Stationary point]]) 
- Second order condition:
	if $f$ is twice [[Differentiable functions|differentiable]] around $x_0$, $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ ([[Gradient]], [[Stationary point]]) and $\nabla^2 f(x^*)$ is positive definite then $x_0$ is a [[strictly local minimum]] ([[convex function]])
