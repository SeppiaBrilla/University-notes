The cross product between two vectors a and b is defined as:
$$
a \times b = ||a|| ||b|| \sin(\theta)n
$$
with $\theta$ the angle between them (from 0 to 180) and **n** is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing **a** and **b**, with direction such that the ordered set (**a**, **b**, **n**) is positively-oriented
