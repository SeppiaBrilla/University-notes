We need to find a way to represent the world we're reasoning on. We can use a set of propositions or [[Ontology|ontologies]] to represent it. The conjunction of all the proposition we're using is called a state.
Sequence of state can represent e evolution of the world. (Same notion and objective as [[Deductive planning]])

## Effect axiom

The effect axiom maps the change of state of a variable / proposition in the next state after an action has taken place. This axiom has the frame problem (see [[Deductive planning]] to know more about it). In order to resolve the frame problem, we need to use a frame axiom that map what does not change with any given action
