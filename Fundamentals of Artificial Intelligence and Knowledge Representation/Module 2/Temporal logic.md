A kind of [[Logic]] built upon [[Modal logic]] that, like [[Situation calculus]] or [[Event calculus]], introduces the concept of evolution over time of the world.
It uses 3 new operators:
- a circle ($\bigcirc$) when somethig is true at the next moment in time
- a square ($\Box$) when something will always be true in the future
- a diamond ($\diamond$) when something will be true sometime in the future
- There exists a moment when $\psi$ holds and $\varphi$ will continuously hold from now until this moment: $\varphi U \psi$ 
- $\varphi$ will continuously hold from now on unless $\psi$ occurs, in which case $\varphi$ will cease $\varphi W \psi$
