All the [[Swarm Intelligence]] algorithms ([[Ant colony optimization]], [[Artificial bee colony algorithm]], [[Particle Swarm optimization]]) requires an accurate parameter tuning activity in order to properly work. This is a tedius, hard and error prone operation that can be automatized with some algorithms like [ParamILS](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/algorithms/Projects/ParamILS/)
