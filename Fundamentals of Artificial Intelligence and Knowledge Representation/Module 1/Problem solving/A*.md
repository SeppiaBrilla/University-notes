A* is a special case of [[Best-First]] algorithm and work kinda in the same way as [[Greedy search]] but, instead of considering only the distance from the current node to the given goal it considers also the distance from the starting node and compute the desirability as the sum of the two distances.
A* does not guarantee to find the optimal solution (it depends on the [[Heuristics]]). If H(n) is the true distance between the current node and the goal A* converge to the optimal solution if a heuristic function H' that forall n H'(n) < H(n) has been chosen.
If H' = 0 A* is equal to [[Breadth-first]].
