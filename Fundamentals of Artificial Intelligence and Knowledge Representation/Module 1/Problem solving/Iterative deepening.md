Is a variance of the [[Limited depth]] strategy ([[Non informed strategies]] to find a solution to a given problem). It perform the [[Limited depth]] algorithm with increasing values of maximum depth until it find a solution.
- It is complete
- $O(b^d)$ in time
- $O(bd)$ in space
- Optimal if each step cost is 1
