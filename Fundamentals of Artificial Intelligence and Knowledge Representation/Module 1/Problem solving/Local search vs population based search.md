## [[Local search]] is better when:
- neighbourhood structures create correlated search graphs
- computational cost is low
- inventing a move is easy

## [[Population based search]] is better when:
- solutions can be encoded as composition of good building blocks
- computational cost of moves is high
- is difficult to disign a neighbourhood structure
- coarse grained exploration is preferrable (e.g. huge search space)
