Swarm intelligence is a [[Search strategies|search strategy]] that find the best possible solution in an iterative way by using different agents that work "together" to find a the solution.

## A swarm intelligence algorithm is composed of:
- A set of simple individuals with limited capacities not awared of the whole system
- Local comunication patterns(direct or indirect)
- Distributed computation
- Robusteness
- Adaptivity

They work with positive and negative feedback that modifies the swarm behaviour
