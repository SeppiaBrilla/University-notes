The choiche on how to expand a search tree is called "strategy".


## Kind of strategies
- [[Non informed strategies]]
- [[informed strategies]]
- [[Local search]]
- [[Population based search]]

## How to evaluate a search strategy
- Completeness: does the algorithm guarantee to find a solution if it exists
- Time complexity: how long does it take to find the solution?
- Space complexity: how much memory do the algorithm need to be performed?
- Optimality: does the algorithm find the best possible solution when more then one is present?
