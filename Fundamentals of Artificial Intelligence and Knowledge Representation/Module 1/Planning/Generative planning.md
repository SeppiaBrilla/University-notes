It is an off-line [[Planning]] technique that generates the whole plan before execution and operates on a snapshot of the current state.
It is based on some assumption:
- Atomic time: action non interruptable
- Deterministi effect
- Initial state fully known
- The plan exection is the only thing that can change the world
it is the opposite of [[Reactive planning]]
