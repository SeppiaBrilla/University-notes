Is a [[Planning]] technique that uses a heuristic function to find a solution in the graph generated by [[Graph-based planning]]. It estimates the distance between the current state and the goal and uses path-finding algorithms like [[Iterative improvement - hill climbing]] or [[A*]] to find the solution.
