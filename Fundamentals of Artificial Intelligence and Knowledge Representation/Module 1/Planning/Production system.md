Is a program that perform a [[Search strategies]] to a problem.
Consists of: 
- a set of ruels
- a working memory
- a control strategy


## forward or data driven production system
Its initial states consists of the initial knowledge about the problem and the rules are choosen by antecendent matching them with the working memory. The process ends with success when the goal to prove is in memory

## backward or goal driven production system
The memory contains the goal at its initial state. The rules are choosen by consequent matching with the working memory. At each step new sub-goals are added to the memory and the procedure ends when the initial state is in memory

The combination of the two system can be applied.
