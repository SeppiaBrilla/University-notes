Is a type of [[Propagation algorithms]] for [[Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation/Module 1/Costraints/Constraint satisfaction problem|CSP]].
At each assignment of variable ($x_i$) the algorithm propagates the constraints involving $x_i$ to all further variable not yet instantiated. The main idea is that, since each assignment impacts the possible value of other variables, we can use this knowledge to prune the values (and so avoid checking them) that will be inconsistent after that assignment.
