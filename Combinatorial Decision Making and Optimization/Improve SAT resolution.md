As already stated, [[SAT]] is a NP-complete problem and resolving it, in the worst scenario, requires exponential time. However, the "naive" approach to the SAT resolution can be vastly improved and a large amount of computational time can be saved.

Main approaches:
- [[Conflict-driven clause learning]]
- [[Watched literals]]
