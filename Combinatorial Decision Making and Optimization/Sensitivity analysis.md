Sensitivity analysis refers to how the optimal solution of a problem ([[Linear programming]] or [[Operations research]]) is affected by changes in the input parameters.
If x* is the optimal solution for standard LP problem P, will x* be still feasible and/or optimal for a perturbed problem?

### Changing value
Cost coefficients: Changing $c \rightarrow c = c + \Delta c$ canâ€™t affect feasibility, but may involve:
- Loss of optimality
- Different objective value for current solution (still optimal)

### Changing constraints
The impact of changing a coefficient $A \rightarrow A = A + \Delta A$ depends on whether $a_{i,j}$ refers to a variable $x_j$ in the optimal basis
