Warping refers to transformations of the spatial domain of images, while [[Image filters|filtering]] refers to changes in the values of images

If we have a function that computes point in image Iâ€™ starting from point in image I, we can copy the value:

## Forward mapping

After applying the warping function in general, we get continuous coordinates, not discrete ones. Possible choices to make it discrete: truncate, neareast neighbor (i.e. rounding).
Regardless of the choice of the mapping, due to rounding we can have:
- more than one pixel can go to one position (folds)
- some pixels of the destination image may not be hit (holes)

## Backward mapping

As forward mapping, but the other way around, and solves the problem of the other method.

### Bilinear Interpolation
Is a way of choosing the color of the pixel with the respect to the original ones
