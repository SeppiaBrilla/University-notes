They are image filters that consist in a 2 sensor noise Image Filters are image processing operators that compute the new intensity (color) of a pixel, p, based on the intensities (colors) of those belonging to a neighborhood (aka support) of p. With them, we can achieve a variety of image processing functions like denoising ([[Noise]]) or sharpening.

## Linear Translation Equivariant (LTE)

They are image filters that consist in a 2d [[Convolution]] between the imput image and the impulse response function (kernel function or similar, see also [[Non-linear class boudaries]]).
LTE operators are often used as feature estractors in Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Types of filters

Here are some types of filters we can apply to our images:
- [[Mean filter]]
- [[Gaussian filter]]
- [[Median filter]]
- [[Bilateral filter]]
- [[Non-local mean filter]]
