It may happen that, after a photo is captured ([[Perspective projection|here's how]]), it may present some sort of noise: irregularities in the image due to the [[Lenses]] or the envinronment. 

## Signal-to-noise ratio

SNR is the intensity of noise measured at a pixel under perfect conditions. It may vary due to presence of random nose.
The main source can be:
- __Photon shot noise__: the time between photon arrivals at a pixel is governed by a Poisson statistics, and thus the number of photons collected during exposure time is not constant.
- __Electronic Circuitry Noise__: It is generated by the electronics which reads-out the charge and amplifies the resulting voltage signal.
- __Quantization Noise__: related to the final ADC conversion (in digital cameras).
- __Dark Current Noise__: a random amount of charge due to thermal excitement is observed at each pixel even though the sensor is not exposed to light.

SNR is measured in decibels ($20 * log_{10}(SNR)$) or bits ($log_2(SNR)$)


## Visualizing and understanding the noise

Where k is the instant in which the photo as been taken and N is the [[Gaussian (normal) distribution]].
In order to remove the noise, we can extract the initial pixel as:
$$
O(p) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N I_k(p) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N (\tilde{I}_k(p) + n_k(p)) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N \tilde{I}_k(p) + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N n_k(p) \cong \tilde{I}(p)
$$

This is if we have a moltitude of photos, what if we have a single one?
We may use the neighbourhood of the pixel to try and guess its "true" value. ==>
$$
O(p) = \frac{1}{|K|} \sum_{q \in K}^N I(q) = \frac{1}{|K|} \sum_{q \in K}^N (\tilde{I}(q) + n(q)) = \frac{1}{|K|} \sum_{q \in K}^N \tilde{I}(q) + \frac{1}{|K|} \sum_{q \in K}^N n(q) \cong \tilde{I}(q)
$$
And that is what we call an [[Image filters]].

## Mean filter

It is the simplest possible [[Image filters]] that uses [[Convolution]]. It denoise the image by multiplying the full image by a matrix of size $n^2$ with values $\frac{1}{n^2}$. It works as a low passing filter that smooth the image. With this process, the image gets blurrier.
