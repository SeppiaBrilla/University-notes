Given two [[events]] $A, B$ we denote as $P(B)$ the [[Probability]] of $B$. But, if we assume correlation between the two events we may want to know what happend to the [[Probability]] of $B$ if the [[events|event]] $A$ occour (or is assumed it has). We can call that the conditional probability $P(B|A)$, the [[Probability]] of $B$ given $A$.
and it is computed as:
$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
$$
