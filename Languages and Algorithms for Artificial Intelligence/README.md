This class was organized in 4 modules. Of those, 2 were completely useless. Here how they were split:
- module 1: a brief introduction to computer programming in python. Not better than any 2 hours introduction video on YouTube
- module 2: logic and declarative languages, very cool
- module 3: a brief introduction to complexity and computability theory, nothing extraordinary but decent enough
- module 4: probabilistic programming: a very brief introduction to [WebPPL](http://webppl.org/). The professor basically said: "use flip and condition". Completely useless

For the reason stated above, module 1 and 4 have no notes, just [Google](https://googlethatforyou.com/) the documentation.
