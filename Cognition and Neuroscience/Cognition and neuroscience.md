# Neuroscience

The study of how the nervous system is organized and functions.
It works at different level of investigation:
- __Molecular__: molecular neuroanatomy, mechanisms of molecular signaling in the nervous system
- __Cellular__: study of neurons at a cellular level including morphology and physiological properties
- __Neural circuits and system__: how neural circuits are formed and function to generate behaviors, such as:
	- sensory perception and multisensory integration
	- motor reflex and actions

### Localizationism
The theory that tells that each part of the human brain is specialized in something.

### Aggregate field theory
The theory that tells that some areas of the brain are more specialized, but the whole brain works to achieve something.

We now know that both theories are partially true.

## Others cool stuff about neuroscience history

### Cytoarchitectonics 
The study of cellular architecture or how cells differ between regions.

### The black reaction
it permits to visualize individual neurons thanks to silver chromate.

### Neuron doctrine
The nervous system is made of single individual cells

### Principle of dynamic polarization
The signal in the neurons has a direction

### Principle of connectional specificity
There are specific points where the cells connect to each other, and they are not random.

### Synapses
Connections between neurons. They can be chemical or electrical.

# Cognition

The description, explanation, and simulation of human thought processes.
It includes many processes like:
- __Perception__: take in information from the envinronment
- __Attention__: allows to focus
- __Learning__: manipulation of new information and integration with prior knowledge
- __Memory__: store information
- __Action__: use information to interact with the envinronment
- __Language__: the ability to understand and express thoughts, it allows communication.
- __Thought__: allows to engage in decision-making and problem-solving


## Some cool stuff about cognition

### Rationalism 
The belif that all knowledge could be gained through reasoning. It is kinda becomed a religion.

### Empiricism
The belif that all knowledge comes from nature and observation of phenomena. The reasoning is just the process of aggregating information gained through observation.

### Montreal's procedure
A method to treat epilepsy by destroyng the neurons causing it.
