Neurons are the cells in the brain responsable for the information share and manipulation.
Here are the different types of neurons:

There are 100 billion neurons in our brain that are of 100 different types. Each neruon receive and gives rise to thousands of connections. Neurons vary in their form, location, and interconnectivity within the nervous system, and these variations are closely related to their functions.

## Structure

![[Pasted image 20230304145717.png]]

Components found in almost all eukaryotic cells: 
- __Membrane__: separate the cell from the outside
- __Cytoplasm__: intracellular fluid that is made up of a combination of ions, predominantly ions of potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium, as well as molecules such as proteins.
- __The extracellular fluid__: a bath where the neurons sit, made up of a mixture of the same types of ions found in the intracellular fluid.
- __Cell body or soma__: metabolic center of the cell. It contains the nucleus, which contains  the genes of the cell, and the endoplasmic reticulum, where proteins are synthesized.

A neuron is also composed of:
- __Dendrites__: the string that connect with other neurons and allow receiving information and signals.
- __Axon__: Is the output of the cell. It is covered by [[Glalias|oligodendrocytes]].
- __Synapse__: also string looking, they enable the output to be shared with other neurons.

### More on synapses

Depending on who is receiving or giving the information, a neuron can be Post synaptic (receiving) or Pre synaptinc (giving). The narrow space separating the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell is called Synaptic cleft.
Type of synapses:
- __Axosomatic__: synapses that are made onto the soma or cell body of a neuron.
- __Axodendritic__: synapses that one neuron makes onto the dendrite of another neuron. The most common type.
- __Axoaxonic__: synapses made by one neuron onto the synapse of another neuron. Axoaxonic synapses mediate presynaptic inhibition and presynaptic facilitation.

## Neurons classification

There are 3 main types of neurons, separated by their functional category:
- __Sensory__: carry information from the body pheripherals to the nervous system.
- __Motor__: carry commands from the brain to the body
- __Interneurons__: mediate the impulses between sensory and motor neurons
