What does it mean, to see?  
Vision is the process of discovering what is present in the world, and where it is.
Vision is a process that produces from images of the external world a description that is useful to the viewer and not cluttered with irrelevant information.
Vision is often incorrectly compared to the operation of a camera. A camera simply reproduces point-by-point the light intensities in one plane of the visual  
field. The visual system, in contrast, does something fundamentally different. It  
interprets the scene and parses it into distinct components, separating foreground  
from background.

Traditionally, a visual scene is analyzed at three levels: low, intermediate and high.
- At the lowest level, visual attributes such as local contrast, orientation, color, depth and motion are processed.
- Low-level features are used to parse the visual scene. Local orientation is integrated into global contours; local visual features are assembled into surfaces, objects are segregated from background, surface shape is identified from depth, shading and kinematic cues.
- The highest level concerns object recognition.

### Visual field 
Is the area that can be seen as you fixate your eyes on a central point

### Eyes split
The retina of each eye can be divided into two part: left and right.
The left hemiretinas (temporal of the left eye, and nasal of the right eye) see the right (opposite) visual hemifield.
The right hemiretinas (nasal of the left eye, and temporal of the right eye) see the left (opposite) visual hemifield.
Because the temporal hemiretina of one eye sees the same visual hemifield as the nasal hemiretina of the other eye, partial decussation of the optic nerve fibers at the chiasm  
ensures that all information related to each hemifield is processed in the visual cortex of the contralateral hemisphere.

In primates, LGN is a layered structure consisting of six layers, of which two Magnocellular layers (layers 1 and 2), and four Parvocellular layers (layers 3 to  
6). Each layer receives input from either the ipsilateral eye (temporal hemiretina, layers 2, 3, 5) or the contralateral eye (nasal hemiretina, layers 1, 4, 6)

### Receptive field
Visual neurons respond to stimuli in only a limited region of space. This region of space is referred to as that cell’s receptive field (RF).

### Eccentricity
The receptive fields of the retinal ganglion cells that monitor portions of the fovea subtend about 0.1° (equal to 6 min of arc), while those in the visual periphery reach up to 1° of visual angle or more.

### Cortical magnification
The amount of cortical area devoted to each degree of the visual field, known as the  
magnification factor, varies with eccentricity.


## Types of receptors

Humans, like most vertebrates, possess two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, differing in shape, function, connectivity and distribution in the retina.
- Rods (100 million) are mainly for night (or scotopic) vision. They can signal the absorption of 1 single photon; their response saturated in daylight, and they cease to respond to variation of intensity
- Cones (5 million) are only for daytime (or photopic) vision. They are much less sensitive to light, make no contribution to night vision, but have higher spatial and temporal resolution (their response is considerably faster than that of rods)

RGCs respond only weakly to uniform stimulation. RGC mainly emphasize the contrasts of brightness.
