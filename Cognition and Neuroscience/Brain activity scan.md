Here are some methods to scan the brain in search of activity to understand what part of the brain is related to a certain behavior.

## Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

Measures the ratio of oxygenated to de-oxygenated hemoglobin. When a neuron is working, it requires more oxygen. The change of oxygen concentration change the magnetic field of that particular area of the brain and, given that, we can understand what part of the brain is working at a given moment.

## Lesional method

Study of the consequences resulting from brain lesions.
