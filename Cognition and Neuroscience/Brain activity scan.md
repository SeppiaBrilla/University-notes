Here are some methods to scan the brain in search of activity to understand what part of the brain is related to a certain behaviour.

## Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

Measures the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin. When a neuron is working, it requires more oxigen. The change of oxigen concentration change the magnetic field of that particular area of the brain and, given that, we can understand what part of the brain is working at a given moment.

## Lesional method

Study of the consequences resulting from brain lesions.
