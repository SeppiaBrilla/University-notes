A way of learning that involves an action of the agent and not a passive observation event.
Example:
- I see that after a lighting there's a thunder -> I expect the thunder after I see a huge ligh -> [[Associative learning]].
- I see that pressing a button gives me food -> I press the button whenever I'm hungry -> Instrumental conditioning.

## Types of instrumental conditioning

There are 4 main types of instrumental conditioning, and they differ from each other by the way we react to the outcome:
- __Positive reinforcement__: Delivery of rewarding outcome increases the probability of emitting the action
- __Positive punishment__: Delivery of aversive outcome decreases the probability of emitting the action
- __Negative reinforcement__: Omission of aversive outcome increases the probability of emitting the action
- __Negative punishment__: Omission of rewarding outcome decreases the probability of emitting the action

## Frequency of delivering
The frequency of the outcome also strongly influence the behaviour:
- __Continuous schedule__: most effective when trying to teach a new behavior
- __Partial schedule__: Behaviors are acquired more slowly, but the response is more resistant to extinction

### Ratio of delivering in partial schedule
In partial schedule, we can deliver the outcome with a fixed or with a variable ratio / interval. Normally, the interval ration keeps the agent hooked for a longer period of time .
