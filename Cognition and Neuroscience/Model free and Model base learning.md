Are two ways of [[Learning]], model free learning is about connecting a stimulus to a response / action to take. Model base is about create a cognitive map of the situation and use that to elaborate a response. Example:
We need to escape a maze, we are given the solution we can either:
- learn the exact path and follow it (Model free)
- learn the structure of the maze and find a way out (Model base)

The first one is way cheaper to remember and "compute" but at cost of repetability: if we end up in a different part of the maze we cannot escape it, while with a model base structure it would be easier to figure out the path.

### Habitual behavior/actions
An action made automatically because, in the past, had led to a successfull outcome.
