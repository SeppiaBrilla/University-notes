Transferring information involves transient changes in the electrical state of the neuron produced by temporary changes in the electric current into and out of the cell.
The electric state of a resting neuron has a voltage of -70 mV less than the voltage outside the neuron. This difference in charge can be achieved thanks to the asymmetric distribution of ions across the cell membrane. Two main mechanisms:
- __Na+/K+ pump__: 
	- Use energy to actively transport ions through the membrane  
	- transports more NA+ outside than K+ inside  
	- creates a concentration gradient: Na+ wants to enter the cell, K+ wants to exit the cell
- __Ion channel__:
	- Allow ions to flow passively down their concentration gradient  
	- the membrane permeability to K+ is larger because there are many more K+ - selective channels than any other type of ion channel --> creates electrical gradient, as K+ exit the cell, they leave behind a cloud of negative charge on the inner surface of the membrane 

Having this different voltage allow the nuron to work as a battery and the voltage can be used to activate the neuron and share information. A neuron works like this:

1) Depolarization: the neuron activate and the voltage-gated Na+ channels open. The influx of positive charge neutralize the negativa charge inside.
2) The equilibrium potential.
3) Voltage gated K+ channels open, allowing K+ to flow out of the neuron down its concentration gradient.
4) Hyperpolarization: The neuron goes under its normal equilibrium state in order to have a periond when it can't be activated (Refractory period).
5) Return to normal resting phase.
