Learning about the properties of a single stimulus: subject is exposed once or repeatedly to a single type of stimulus.
Two kinds of non-associative learning:  
1. __Habituation__: a decrease in an innate response to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly. Less likely for the subject to respond to innocuous stimuli  
2. __Sensitization__: an increase in an innate response to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly. More likely for the subject to respond to potentially noxious stimuli
