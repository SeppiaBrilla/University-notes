Change in response is caused by learning about the association of at least two stimuli or events. Change in response is caused by learning about the association of at least two stimuli or events:  
- A neutral stimulus/event  
- A stimulus/event that is a reinforcer  
Associative learning is the way in which an animal learns to predict events and control them, in order to maximize rewarding outcomes and minimize aversive outcomes to increase chances of survival.

### Primary reinforcer/unconditioned stimulus  
â€¢ A stimulus that is biologically relevant and prepared to elicit a response. Can be positive or negative.  

### Secondary reinforcer  
A stimulus that comes to elicit a response following associative learning. It has becomed relevant after an associative learning experience. Can be positive or negative.

# Pavlovian or classical conditioning

When a stimulus is presented that has no meaning to an animal, such as the sound of a bell, there is no response. However, presentation of a meaningful stimulus (like food) generates an unconditioned response. When the sound is paired with the food, the animal learns the association; and later the newly conditioned stimulus alone can elicit the response, which is now called a conditioned response

## Different types of conditional responses

Responses can be: 
- Behavioral
- Physiological
- Change in subjective experience

### Behavioral
The animal responds to the conditioned stimulus with a conditioned response that prepares the animal for, or protects it from, the predicted unconditioned stimulus.  
The timing of the conditioned stimulus before the unconditioned one is crucial.

### Physiological

## Frequency also matters

### Continuous Reinforcement  
The CS is reinforced with the US every single time it occurs. It most effective when trying to teach a new association.

### Partial reinforcement  
The CS is reinforced only part of the time. Associations are acquired more slowly with partial reinforcement, but the response is more resistant to extinction.


### Fear/threat/aversive conditioning
Is a particular kind of classical conditioning that involves the use of fear to stimulate a response.
