This project aims to collect notes from the 2022/2023 course on [Artificial intelligence at the University of Bologna](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence). These notes are mine and are not perfect or correct so, do not take for true whatever you read but always verify them first (and fix them if you like). 
This notes are incomplete and will be updated while my studies goes on.

## Tools
You'll find mostly markdown notes taken with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The code is mostly python, written with [Jupiter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on VS Code.

## Methodologies
The notes are organized in folders. Each folder contains the specific notes from a particular course.
The notes mostly try to follow the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) metodology (with a certain degree of freedom). It is possible that some topics have multiple notes: I do that whenever I feel that a different take on the same subject is needed.
